Align The Chakras- MS2

Align The Chakras is a simple card matching game. In this game we have several rows of cards. We then have to flip over two cards at a time in
hopes of finding the match. In the event we do not choose the matching cards, our cards will automatically flip back over and we have
the chance to try again. The cards will automatically shuffle for the next round.

# Testing
The game on the website was tested for screen resposiveness to ensure breakpoints. This game does not pass any breakpoints.


The code was ran through each specific validator to make sure it passed.
All code passed the validator except for this error with JavaScript:
Error: Non-space characters found without seeing a doctype first. Expected <!DOCTYPE html>.

From line 1, column 1; to line 1, column 56

const cards = document.querySelectorAll('.memory-card');↩↩let 

Removed unnecessary code that was flagged in HTML validator.

Ran CSS through WS3 validator- PASSED.

# Deployment
Align The Chakras has been deployed on GitHub Pages with the following process:

All code was written on Gitpod, a cloud-based IDE.

The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my Repository.

Under the Settings section of the GitHub repository, scroll down to GitHub Pages section.

Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.

Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site URL.

There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.

The code can be run locally through clone or download. You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.

The Clone option provides a URL, which you can use on your desktop IDE.

The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine or uploaded to your cloud-based IDE workspace.

# Apologies

* I truly apologize for even turning a project so insulting in. I have worked on this for three months, just to bring you this garbage. 
My original game found here: http://github.com - Original game!
[GitHub]( https://susanmarie87.github.io/Match-My-Oils/) Just would not work. The Javascript would sort of function in Dev Tools but on the site
it would not function at all. I reached out for help but was unable to grasp the concept here. 
 I buried myself here but just wanted to showyou that I did not just intentionally steal someone's code to pass off on my own in a week, I'm just 
 this horrible at coding. You can look through my workspacess and see the rest of my horrid attempts at this game. Needless to say, I have a lot of
work to do to hopefulle begin to understand this JavaScript mess.
